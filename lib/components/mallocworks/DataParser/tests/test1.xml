<description>The Newsroom - I am one of the invisible unemployed, one of the nation&#039;s millions of job-seekers not counted in the unemployment statistics.With three school-aged children, mounting medical bills and a sick husband, my job hunt has become desperate.Fourteen years ago, I gave up my position as a government attorney to become a stay-at-home mom in Silver Spring, Md. This winter, with the children in and approaching their teens and my husband&#039;s health deteriorating, I started looking for a full-time position. I was confident my experience -- which included guiding a program with a nearly $20 billion budget and negotiating with some of the top corporations in the world -- would quickly translate into success. But the hurdles exceeded my expectations.I&#039;m 52, it&#039;s been 14 years since I worked in a professional capacity and the worst recession of my lifetime is underway.The job market has changed dramatically since 1995. Unemployment is hovering at 10 percent. The job search has moved online. I eagerly explored the new milieu, still convinced my professional qualifications would shine brightly in the recession. It was only a matter of time before I found work, I thought.Early this summer, I&#039;d been job-hunting about six months without a single interview when disaster struck. We learned my husband&#039;s &quot;tendonitis&quot; was actually kidney cancer that had spread to his bones. In the whirlwind of tests and consultations, we strained to come to terms with &quot;limb-sparing surgery&quot; and &quot;life-extending drug therapy.&quot; His cancer is fierce and incurable.My husband used his sick and annual leave during an original bout with cancer. Now he can take extensive unpaid time off or retire, permanently cutting his pay in half. Thus, I need work immediately.There&#039;s no safety net like the unemployment extension to sustain me while I look for work because I am not officially unemployed. The meager income my husband can bring in plus the pittance I earn from online writing is nowhere near enough to support a family of five.We&#039;ve made necessary and painful budget cuts. Non-urgent medical care is delayed while we keep up with urgent care. $8,000 of orthodontia not reimbursed by insurance is on hold. Vision care is stretched to two-year intervals. Follow-up dental care -- $100 to $300 out-of-pocket per person -- is spread out so long after the free dental check-up, it&#039;s time for the next check-up by the time cavities are filled.And the fun stuff is on hold, too. We told our children, who were used to overnight summer camps, they could no longer attend their dance, farm and math camps.Telling them &quot;not this year&quot; brings back memories of my own financially stressed childhood when &quot;maybe next year&quot; meant &quot;not in this lifetime.&quot; We&#039;re a far cry from poor. But our kids, surrounded by relative affluence, feel poor by contrast. My daughters don&#039;t understand why &quot;everyone else&quot; can afford several overnight camps in a single summer.&quot;Why are we so poor?&quot; they want to know. &quot;Why is it taking so long for you to find a job?&quot;In the D.C. area, where we live, the government is the predominant employer. My past accomplishments as a government lawyer should position me for the best jobs. But though I&#039;ve applied for legal, policy and management jobs, no one has expressed interest.The lack of interest my resume has generated is disheartening. I rewrite it, thinking it&#039;s not catchy enough. I circulate it to friends, asking for suggestions. At each step, I remind myself how important it is to keep my spirits up and approach the job hunt enthusiastically, so I banish those invasive thoughts about cancer outcomes.Who can help me find a job? I&#039;m not fussy. On Monday afternoon, I was emailing with a friend of a friend of a friend, who offered to pass my resume to her professional contacts. The ultimate receiver of my resume may not know any of the people down the line who passed it along. But if that person has a job to offer and will take a moment to consider my credentials, that&#039;s good enough for me.</description>

<description>The Newsroom - By 1952, Marlon Brando was well on his way in Hollywood, with three incredible roles under his belt: his big-screen debut as a paraplegic war vet in The Men; a searing on-screen reprisal of his Broadway turn as the iconic brute Stanley Kowalski in director Elia Kazan&#039;s A Streetcar Named Desire; and the title role in the biopic, Viva Zapata!, about the Mexican revolutionary hero. But for all those successes, remarkably the actor had not yet made the cover of LIFE magazine. In &#039;52, that oversight was remedied, as legendary photographer Margaret Bourke-White shot a portrait session with Brando, capturing the 28-year-old star in a casual, playful mood. For reasons unknown, those photos -- recently discovered in LIFE&#039;s archives and marked with the sole descriptive phrase, &quot;cover tries&quot; -- were never published. Until now. Here&#039;s Brando at his sexy best, seen through the lens of one of LIFE&#039;s greatest photographers.</description>
